</ul>
<ul>The marinade
    <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>Fresh cracked pepper</li>

<ol>Cooking Instructions
    <li>To prepare the garlic butter steak recipe with potatoes wedges: 
        In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, 
        olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside and allow steak 
        strips to marinate while you cook potatoes</li>

    <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive
         oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes
          wedges. Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and cook an additional 4-5
           minutes until potatoes wedges are golden and fork-tender. Transfer
            sauteed potatoes to a plate and set aside.</li>

    <li>Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons
         of butter, garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and fresh herbs. Lay the steak
          strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the drained steak marinade for
           later. Cook the steak strips on each side for 1 minute each, until nicely
            browned adjust timing depending on how you like your steak.</li>

    <li>Right before the Garlic Butter steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade
         if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the potatoes wedges back to the garlic 
         butter steak pan and heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if 
         necessary.</li>

    <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately your steak and potatoes, garnished with
         more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese 
         over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!</li>
